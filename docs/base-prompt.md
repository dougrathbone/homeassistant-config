You're helping me work on my house's Home Assistant automation and configuration files. The details can be found at @project-guide.md

You also have a file @project-plan.md that is YOUR file. You can edit it, update is, and mark things off. Please read it to undersatnd where you're up to and to keep a diary of your changes.

Some of the key files for context are:
- @automations.yaml the main home assistant automation file
- @Clipsal.xml the CGate configuration file for all CGate entities
